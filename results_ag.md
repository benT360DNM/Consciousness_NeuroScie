Patients whose lesions included **≥ 50 AG voxels** showed significantly higher acute NIHSS compared with patients with no AG damage  
(Cohen’s d = 0.59, 95 % CI 0.49 – 0.69; n = 746 vs n = 1 043).

> Interpretation Prediction 1 is confirmed: angular-gyrus damage is associated with greater overall stroke severity.
